# Animated-Linked-List
Description: Program asks for integer inputs and inserts/creates a linked list with them.
The program prints out a text-based list in the console and prints out an updated one each
time a node is inserted. The program also draws a graphical version of the list. Each time
a node is inserted, an updated list gets drawn making an animation since the drawing changes
each time; the inserted node is also highlighted in green. I use a graphics library created 
by a University of Arizona computer science professor, Ben Dicken, in order to draw the list 
and animate it. list_node.py is imported to create list node objects for the linked list, lastly 
sys is imported for the standard input of the numbers.

How to run: Run the program and input integers in the console and press enter. Each time this 
happens, a GUI version of the list will be displayed and so will a text based version in the 
console. Multiple nodes can be inserted into the list at a time if the inputs are spaced apart 
by a single space.
